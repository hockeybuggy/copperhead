# Simple Interpreter.

I am taking a crack at writing a simple interpreter that uses something similar
to python byte code. Completely a toy project for practice.

## TODO

- [ ] Get stackframes working
- [ ] Switch to code objects
- [ ] Test behaviour of simple instructions (the ones currently in main.rs)
- [ ] Other operators
- [ ] Conditionals
- [ ] Function calling sequence
